# Bitlocker-Unlocker
Bitlocker-Unlocker
.SYNOPSIS

This is a script to brute force attack the last 6 digits of a Bitlocker recovery key

.DESCRIPTION

At the moment, this only works for the last set of digits of the BitLocker recovery key. I will be working in a slightly different version of a BitLocker unlocker which can be run in any version of powershell using a brute force attack for the password only. Trying to recovery all values of a recovery key is out of the scope of this script. The script can be created, but it is not feasible to do that. This is just a case study and demonstration. There are other GitHub repositories that have already tackle this; for example, the following link give you a different take on this matter.
