# Bitlocker-Unlocker
Bitlocker-Unlocker
.SYNOPSIS

This is a script to brute force attack the last 6 digits of a Bitlocker recovery key

.DESCRIPTION

At the moment this only works for the last set of digits of the recovery key.
I will be working in a slightly different version of a bitlocker unlocker which can be run in any version of powershell using a brute force attack for the password only.
Trying to recovery all value for a recovery key is out of the scope of this script. The script can be created, but it is not feaseble to do that. This is just a case study and demonstration. There are other GitHub repository that have already tackle this (links below).
